abstract = {In this paper, we outline a projection on the trend of using web technologies for creating end-user applications in mobile devices. Following a paradigm shift in the software industry, from only-binary applications to dynamic web applications, mobile web development tools evolve to offer an integral native solution that allows to simplify the soft-ware process and broad its scope to a true, single cross-platform development effort. Soon, mobile web development tools will be preferred by designers and programmers thanks to their versatility, economy and usefulness, less dependent on specific platforms and SDKs, while fully functional and reliable in comparison to their binary counterparts.},
